    <img src="becoming-a-computer-hardware-engineer.jpg">Computer hardware engineers research, design, develop, and test computer systems and components such as processors, circuit boards, memory devices, networks, and routers. By creating new designs in computer hardware, these engineers create rapid advances in computer technology. Many computer hardware engineers design non-computer devices that incorporate processors and other computer components and connect to the Internet. For example, there are many car parts with computer systems embedded in them. A growing number of medical devices are also designed by computer hardware engineers with a computer system and the ability to connect to the Internet.
